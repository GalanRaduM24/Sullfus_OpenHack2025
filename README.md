# **RentHub**

A rental matching platform designed to make renting **faster, safer, and more personal** for both tenants and landlords.

---

## **Overview**

Finding a rental apartment can be stressful, time-consuming, and expensive. Landlords often struggle to know if a tenant is reliable before meeting them.

**RentHub** solves these problems by matching tenants with apartments and landlords with tenants based on preferences, trust profiles, and optional introduction videos. Both sides only connect when there’s a good fit, saving time and reducing uncertainty.
